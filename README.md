# Wordhunt Solver
## Credits
- words.txt is from [dwyl/english-words](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words)
- words2.txt is from [matthewreagan/WebstersEnglishDictionary](https://github.com/matthewreagan/WebstersEnglishDictionary)
  - to create the txt file, I extracted all the keys from the `dictionary.json` file
- words3.txt is the same as words.txt but with the added words from `update_words.py` which adds the plural forms of words
## How to use
1. Change the code and files specified in Line 7 of `cheat.py`
2. Make a new python 3.9 environment and install `requirements.txt`
2. Run python `cheat.py`
3. If you need to stop the program, move the mouse to the top left corner of the screen, which acts as a failsafe for `pyautogui`
